## A Figma plugin to reset your text layer names

![GIF example](/Artwork/artwork.gif)

This is a fork with additional features.

Ever end up wanting to reset your layer names, so the name reflects your text content? How about having to do that repeatedly for TONS of layers or components? ðŸ˜°  It's not possible to reset them all at once, UNTIL NOW!

"How do I get started?"

Easy! Just select any amount of layers (be it Frames, Groups, Components, etc.), run the "Reset Text Layer Name" command, and the plugin will find text layers in each selected layer and reset their names.

Boom! You're done. ðŸŽ‰
